# CoronaTrackerEsp32

An alternative for the [Corona-Warn-App](https://www.coronawarn.app/de/) for the ESP32. 

## Overview

Goal of the project is to create a do it yourself coronatracker.
We use a cheap microcontroller (ESP32) with bluetooth and wifi.
Our code is compatible with the german Corona-Warn-App. Our tracker recognizes smartphones with the Corona-Warn-App and they recognize our tracker. 
The idea is that you can carry the tracker instead of having the app on your smartphone.
The tracker is connected to a chosen wifi so it can request the infected keys from the official Corona-Warn-App server and warn you if you met someone infected.

This project is still work in progress and some features are incomplete/not yet implemented.

## Hardware

The software should work on most ESP32 boards. Internally we use **LILYGOÂ® TTGO ESP32 WiFi + Bluetooth 18650 Battery Protection Board**, mainly because of usability of 18650 batteries.

Depending on how the pins on your board are configured you may need to change them.

## How you can built your own tracker?

Choose a suitable ESP32 board. This tutorial will use the TODO.

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

2. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for VS Code. ([Instructions](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)) There may be a prompt to restart VS Code after installing.

3. Clone or download this project. You can use `Download ZIP`on the top right of this site. Unzip it in a suitable directory.![](doc\images\git_download.png)

4. Open the project with PlatformIO. 

   1. Open Platform IO Home.

   This message should appear at the bottom of the terminal if the upload was successful.

6. The ESP will now start an Access Point called `Coronatracker`to set up WiFi. Connect to the AP and open `192.168.4.1`. (Depending on the device you might get a notification that there i no connection to the Internet) Enter your WiFi Credentials and click safe.

7. The ESP will now start initialization and afterwards simulating the CWA-App.
